I hate having to setup my development environment over and over again. Today I am going to show you how to set it up once. Along with my theme of free Coder.com is perfect for coding anywhere on anything.

Install Hugo 

```
go get -u github.com/gohugoio/hugo
```

Go to `root/go/src/github.com/gohugoio/hugo` and run a `build` command. Once this is done copy the hugo binary to `/usr/local/bin`

Now you can use the `hugo `command anywhere.
