Hey I'm Chris. Just a guy wishing days were 3 times longer so he could get done
with what he wanted to do. I'm making this blog so I can express my ability as a
 developer but also my experiences in life.

On a more personal note...
I'm work in the field of Remote Sensing centered on feature extraction. I spend
most of my free time doing the things I love such as rock climbing or going to
the gym. My favorite past time is programming though. I've never had any super
formal training so even making this blog is a challenge but I'm sure with time
this blog will evolve and so will my skills.


The thing I'm most excited for in this blog is the evolution of myself over
time.
