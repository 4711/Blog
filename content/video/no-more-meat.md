So this one is kind of new...

I decided to give up meat. I have a friend of mine. Her name is Brooke. Also check out her blog <http://happinessandhairpins.com>, but she is a vegetarian. She inspires me with what she can cook and create by using everything else but meat. So I decided that I am going to do one month and see if I can go without meat for the entire month of February of 2018.
